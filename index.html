    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Brandon Keefer. <br>
      I was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. I'm currently 22 years old. I graduated from Bartlett High School in 2017, but I did attend Bolton my freshman year. My favorite sport is easily basketball, but I do genuinely appreciate other sports like soccer, football, skiing, skateboarding, etc. I've played a lot of video games over the course of my life, but if I had to choose my favorite it'd probably be SSX3. Shout out to some of my friends: Javion, Cameron, Brandon, Samira, Naomi, &amp; Peyton.
